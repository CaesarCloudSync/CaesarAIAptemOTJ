Situation 

During my cybersecurity project I took part in interviewing service owners about the cyber security. We would use a document called a TDA (Technical Discovery Assessment) to help understand the software. We would then assess the applications security and grade it in the Maturity assessment. Successfully assessing the security of applications within the organization. 

Task 

This required me to learn about the architectures and applications used. Then interview the client using that information as a base 

Action 

I provided recommendations for improving security posture, including specific vulnerabilities discovered and mitigation strategies.  

Result 

In the end we were able to provide an assessment of their security, we provided recommendations on how we could mitigate them. And identified the risks of the systems.

March 2024  

Situation 

I was put on a second project where Generative AI is largely used for their technology solutions. This led to completing a lot of prompt engineering tasks in python. This meant that I had to complete a lot of code and programs for the problems provided.  

Task 

In a sub-section of the project, we were asked to design a program that would produce advertising claims for a company using Genai.  

 

 

Action 

Initially the notebook we had created was purely in notebook form. I transferred the codebase into an object-oriented form and allowed it to be interacted with on a demo basis. 

Result 

In the end, I was able to help to create the code that would be used in as a test for a workshop.

April 2024 

 

Situation 

For my internal project, I took on a DevOps role that split its architecture between frontend, backend and database with each being in their own subnets.  

Task 

I was asked to setup RabbitMQ as a resource in one of these subnets and expose it to communicate with the other subnets. 

Action 

I set the VPC, the subnet groups, the ports and the route table all in terraform to make sure that everything could communicate. 

Result 

To test we used a virtual machine that was connected to all the subnets to make tests on containers. I was able to help a colleague finish a ticket with in setting it up.

May 2024   

Situation 

I joined a new project. This project has a massive system with many moving components and teams. This requires us to use intricate and specific devops tools. BitBucket is used to store all the needed repositories. Jira is used to create, track and build all the environments and code.  

Task 

For my first project they were simple changes that only required me transferring SQL commands from one file to another. I created a small script to identify them quickly. Once I finished my changes. There is a specific process required to create push, test and merge changes into the master branch.  Involving the act of rebasing, pushing and dealing with merge conflicts etc. 

Action 

 

 

Before I make any changes, I would normally have to make a git pull and rebase, there were merge conflicts so I had to deal with those. And full rebase. 33O095JK439g3I0puRYFMtYqpeCPFqeJ2PvbHnCLzuRJpS3+Z8Sv8HEPjHXwnnSfkAAAAASUVORK5CYII= 

There were some import conflicts 

D456X1oRQ8U3AAAAAElFTkSuQmCCAs well as, extra implementations made by a colleague. 

Dwzh0hL8qJ0CAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC 

I used the merge editor to merge the conflicts.gPaue6LyA1zIfBYEQRAE4ezpFRoeJb23IAiC0KOBb3BM0pt66ERcuLggWD2CsDd0MQGm0LUx6dWLV5EDBN3tqYLCSwXNIuB4U9MZqHmEngLKAeo2kHotdEXQTllb23DMGkEQBEG4FIiLjaFesfF9ZIwuCIIgCIIgCIIgCIIgCIIgCEKPISYmWlxgCYIgCIIgCIIgCIIgCIIgCILQ8xAFiCAIgiAIgiAIgiAIgiAIgiAIPQ5RgAiCIAiCIAiCIAiCIAiCIAiC0OMQBYggCIIgCIIgCIIgCIIgCIIgCD0OUYAIgiAIgiAIgiAIgiAIwv+3Zwc0AAAACIPeP7U9HNQAgDsCBAAAAAAAOFMDYlAkf8RZAeEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=I rebased, made my changes and then pushed the changes. I would then create a tester tag. This tag will be used by the tester to test the environment with my changes. They would deploy my changes on an environment and run regression tests. Jenkins is used to track the builds. 

Result 

When in PR the data will be reviewed by 3 PR reviewers, then it will be ready for merge. And can be merged during a merge slot. 

 

​​☐​ S9: Apply relevant security and resilience techniques to a digital and technology solution. For example, risk assessments, mitigation strategies. 

 

 

February 2024  

 

Situation 

 

We used the NIST Framework, a cybersecurity framework used to assess the validity and maturity of legal processes and documents.  

 

Task 

The task was to interview the client and conduct a maturity assessment to assess the resilience of the systems used by the client. 

 

Action 

I also wrote risk registers for these maturity assessments that the client would use to improve their maturity ratings.  

Result 

I was able to deliver the deliverables to be used in BAU for the client so that the client could conduct future maturity assessments. 

​​☐​ S10: Initiate, design, implement and debug a data product for a digital and technology solution. 

 

June 2024 

 

Situation 

 

My project is dependent on a functionally database that is used by the client to commit actions.  They generally would be provided information on the customers, and they use that tool to make decisions.  
Task 

 

To render what the client will use to analyse their customers, a database is used to store all the possible actions that can be made, how they can be made and by who. 

 
Action 

There was a bug where the client couldn’t edit or delete data on the customer. So, I was asked to change some SQL that would make sure that data could be edit or deleted. Then Java would be added so that the logic behind the data change could be rendered. 

w8Lfp6k1yQrpAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg== 
I then asked for an environment and made the manual tests. F.Y.I - I am not allowed to show the manual test results. Even with redactions. 

 
Result 

In the end I was able to render the options to allow the client to edit or delete data. I made a PR review for the ticket and merged it. These SQL changes made changes to the UI so that actions could be made by the user. 

These changes allowed the user to make changes for this specific use case.

​​☐​ S12: Plan, design and manage simple computer networks with an overall focus on the services and capabilities that network infrastructure solutions enable in an organisational context. 

 

April 2024  

 

Situation 

 

This month in my internal project I took more of Devops role where I was asked to work tickets involving managing the infrastructure of the application. The application was split into the frontend, backend and data storage. Each with their own subnets. The backend and database were in private subnets to avoid unwanted access. With the frontend being in the public subnet to allow internet access from the internet gateway.  

Task 

We needed to set up route tables and DNS zones to allow the subnets to communicate. 

 

Action 

We created a private gateway in Azure, this would be routed by a route table that matched the IP addresses of the subnets. 

Result 

This allowed communication between the database and the rest of the application.

July 2024 

 

Situation 

 

This new project is quite a slow project because it is full of many larger component's teams and testing environments. 

 

Task 

The task was to make changes to the codebase logic, test it locally then test it in an environment. Then send it off to a tester. The problem lies in that there is a select few of environments we can use split between several teams. This can lead to delayed usage. 

 

Action 

To get access to an environment I messaged the testers using the environment to coordinate when I can use it for my tests. They gave me the environment once they were finished so I could make my tests. The sprint ended in a week from now when the merge slot also was. So, I needed to get the changes tested and in PR review as quick as possible.

April 2024  

Situation 

We used Gitlab to store our repositories as well as for our ticketing provider, in devops there are a lot of secret keys and environmental variables that we use. So, the provisioning and storage of these values is taken very seriously. The terraform state also needs to be managed by the developers. This required my team to send me the terraform.tfvars for variables.  

Task 

I was asked to setup the environmental variables on my machine locally. 

Action 

The URLs for secret keys in azure key vault. As well as setting up he terraform.tfstate, which is a universal index of all the changes done in terraform.  

Result 

I followed all the steps to provide myself the correct access and finally set up my environment locally correctly. This allowed me to make my changes and deployments to Azure using Terraform.

Situation 

My partner left for annual leave this month where there was a considerable number of deliverables due for this month.  

 

Task 

 

This meant that I had to take on the delivery of these deliverables as well as juggle my Software Engineering and IT Project management Assignments.  

 

Action 

I delivered a large deliverable the equivalent of 3 deliverables. As well as overseeing 3 more deliverables.

Situation 

When starting on an issue we are provided a ticket on Jira. An update will normally be made in the daily startup on the progress on these tickets. 

Task 

We would check what the requirements of the ticket are and determine who we need to contact for extra information and how we can tackle it. 

Action 

We would determine the repos to make changes to, checkout to a new branch. Then make those changes. We would then push it and deploy it using Jenkins. In this case I also had to make changes to a visual tool used in the project to align with the code. I then manually tested the changes on the frontend. 
Result 

In the end, I was able to finish the ticket and test the changes manually on the frontend.

June 2024 

 

Situation 

 

My project has legacy software and newer software used in conjunction. The legacy software is used by users who have older systems and requirements. 

 
Task 

 

The api requests used between the old and new versions of the software can have a mismatch sometimes and can cause errors on the frontend. As a result, for each important process, the new version and old version translations need to be aligned. 
 

A user processed on the older system would have different data structures and JSON formatting, ID’s etc than the newer system users. 

The older systems IDs to identify the user uses a different prefix and format to the new system ID’s. This would cause logical errors on what is rendered.  
Programatical logic is required to differentiate the old system users and new system users. 
 

 
Action 

 
I identified the places in which the errors were occurring, and used the old version to make the new version api requests align with the backend logic, then I applied it to the frontend and tested it. This is the code that implemented this logic.   

l9P3RLJDD0AAAAAASUVORK5CYII= 

Once the changes have been made, I need to manually test the changes. I messaged a colleague to access an environment and tested the changes.  

 
Result 

 

The result I was looking for was that if a user using the older system made and action or change it would send the user to a not available page rather than throwing an error message. I can’t show screenshots of the manual test however in the end the correct redirections were made.

July 2024  

 

Situation 

 

In order to test our changes, the changes must be deployed to an environment then tested. This can be slow and difficult because only one person at a time can use an environment. As a result, a local environment deployment is being developed by the team. 

Task 

There are separate docker containers for the CSS, static files and main routes. To deploy each a developer would have to manual deploy each container with a command. 

 
Action 

I added changes that made it so that all of the containers could be run with a single command. I pushed it and merged it into master. 

 

Result  

 

This meant that there would be less confusion on how to setup and use the local setup. Simplifying the development process. And speeding up the testing process.
