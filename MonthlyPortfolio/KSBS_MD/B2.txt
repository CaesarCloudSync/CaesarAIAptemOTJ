**Evidence: B2: Reliable, objective, and capable of both independent and team working.**

**March 2024**

**Situation**

I worked with another colleague to produce the summary reports for BAU. There were some gaps in the reports.

**Task**

As a result, I had to book a meeting with a stakeholder and individually fill in the gaps.

**Action**

**How I Ensured I Could Work Independently**

To ensure that I could work independently, I took the following actions:

* **Shadowed a colleague:** I shadowed a more experienced colleague to learn how to conduct a maturity assessment and fill in the summary report.
* **Reviewed previous examples:** I reviewed previous examples of maturity assessments and summary reports to get a better understanding of the format and content required.

**Conducting the Maturity Assessment and Filling in the Gaps**

I conducted the maturity assessment by interviewing the stakeholder and gathering information about the organization's processes and procedures. I then used this information to fill in the gaps in the summary report.

**Result**

I independently filled in the gaps of a deliverable that was of lower quality, and I worked with the rest of the team to generate the summary reports.

**Benefits of Independent and Team Working**

* **Increased efficiency:** By being able to work independently, I was able to complete the tasks more quickly and efficiently.
* **Improved quality:** By working with a team, I was able to get feedback and input from others, which helped to improve the quality of the deliverables.
* **Enhanced collaboration:** By working independently and as part of a team, I was able to enhance my collaboration skills.
