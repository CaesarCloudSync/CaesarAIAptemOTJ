**Evidence: K7: The roles, functions and activities within digital technology solutions within an organisation. + 4 evidences accepted**

**February 2024**

**Situation**

During my cybersecurity project, I participated in interviewing service owners about cybersecurity posture. We used a Technical Discovery Assessment (TDA) document to help understand the software architecture and applications used within the organization. (screenshot of TDA document)

**Task**

This required me to learn about the architectures and applications used. I then interviewed the client using that information as a base. (screenshot of interview notes)

**Action**

I provided recommendations for improving security posture, including specific vulnerabilities discovered and mitigation strategies. (screenshot of vulnerability assessment report)

**Result**

In the end, we were able to provide an assessment of their security, we provided recommendations on how to mitigate vulnerabilities, and identified the risks of the systems. (screenshot of security assessment report)
