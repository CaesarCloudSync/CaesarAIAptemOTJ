**Evidence: K21: How to operate at all stages of the software development life cycle and how each stage is applied in a range of contexts. For example, requirements analysis, design, development, testing, implementation.**

**May 2024**

**Situation**

When starting on an issue, we are provided a ticket on Jira. An update will normally be made in the daily startup on the progress on these tickets.

**Task**

We would check what the requirements of the ticket are and determine who we need to contact for extra information and how we can tackle it.

**Action**

**Stage of the Development Lifecycle**

I operated in the following stages of the software development lifecycle:

* **Requirements analysis:** I analyzed the requirements of the ticket to determine what changes needed to be made.
* **Design:** I designed the changes that needed to be made.
* **Development:** I made the changes to the codebase.
* **Testing:** I manually tested the changes on the frontend.
* **Implementation:** I pushed the changes to the remote repository and deployed them using Jenkins.

**How I Tackled the Ticket**

(screenshot of Jira ticket)

I started by checking out a new branch from the master branch. I then made the changes to the codebase. (screenshot of code changes)

I also had to make changes to a visual tool used in the project to align with the code. (screenshot of visual tool changes)

Once I had made all of the changes, I pushed them to the remote repository and deployed them using Jenkins. (screenshot of Jenkins build)

I then manually tested the changes on the frontend. (screenshot of manual testing)

**Result**

In the end, I was able to finish the ticket and test the changes manually on the frontend.

**Benefits of Operating at All Stages of the Development Lifecycle**

* **Improved understanding of the software development process:** By operating at all stages of the development lifecycle, I gained a better understanding of the entire process.
* **Enhanced problem-solving skills:** By working on a variety of tasks at different stages of the development lifecycle, I developed my problem-solving skills.
* **Increased productivity:** By being able to operate at all stages of the development lifecycle, I was able to be more productive and efficient.
