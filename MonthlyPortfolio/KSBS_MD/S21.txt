**Evidence: S21: Determine, refine, adapt and use appropriate software engineering methods, approaches and techniques to evaluate software engineering project outcomes.**

**July 2024**

**Situation:**

To evaluate the effectiveness of the local environment deployment, we decided to measure the time it took to deploy all three containers manually versus using the single command I implemented.

**Task:**

* Conduct a performance evaluation of the local environment deployment.
* Gather data on deployment times for both manual and automated methods.

**Action:**

* Developed a test plan to measure deployment times.
* Conducted multiple deployment tests with different team members.
* Collected data on deployment times, errors encountered, and developer feedback. (screenshot)

**Result:**

* Analysis of the data showed that the automated deployment method significantly reduced deployment times.
* The single command method consistently deployed all three containers in less than 10 seconds, while manual deployment took an average of 2 minutes.
* The automated method also eliminated errors associated with manual deployment.

**Legal, Ethics and Landscape (Software Engineer)**

* Ensured compliance with data protection regulations by anonymizing the data collected.
* Obtained consent from team members to collect their feedback and deployment times.
* Reviewed the results with stakeholders and addressed their concerns and suggestions.
