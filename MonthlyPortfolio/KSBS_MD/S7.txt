**Evidence: S7: Work effectively within teams, leading on appropriate digital technology solution activities.**

**July 2024**

**Situation**

This new project is quite a slow project because it is full of many larger component's teams and testing environments.

**Task**

The task was to make changes to the codebase logic, test it locally, then test it in an environment, and then send it off to a tester. The problem lies in that there is a select few of environments we can use split between several teams. This can lead to delayed usage.

**Action**

**How I Found Out Which Tester to Message**

I used the team's communication channels to find out who was responsible for testing the environment I needed. I also checked the project backlog to see if there were any tickets assigned to specific testers.

**How I Found Out When the Resource Would Be Available**

I messaged the testers and asked them when the environment would be available. I also checked the team's calendar to see if there were any scheduled maintenance or testing activities that would impact the availability of the environment.

**Message Used to Communicate with the Testers**

```
Hi [Tester Name],

I am working on a task that requires me to test some changes in the [environment name] environment. I understand that you are currently using the environment, so I wanted to ask when you expect to be finished so that I can schedule my tests.

I would appreciate it if you could let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks,
[My Name]
```

**Result**

In the end, I was able to make my tests in the environment and push it to the testers and complete my PR review in time for the merge slot and end of sprint.

**Benefits of Effective Communication**

* Reduced delays: By communicating effectively with the testers, I was able to avoid delays in getting access to the environment.
* Improved collaboration: Effective communication helped to improve collaboration between the development and testing teams.
* Increased productivity: By working together effectively, we were able to increase our productivity and meet the project deadline.
