**Evidence: S9: Apply relevant security and resilience techniques to a digital and technology solution. For example, risk assessments, mitigation strategies.**

**February 2024**

**Situation**

We used the NIST Framework, a cybersecurity framework used to assess the validity and maturity of legal processes and documents.

**Task**

The task was to interview the client and conduct a maturity assessment to assess the resilience of the systems used by the client.

**Action**

**Key Features of the NIST Framework**

The NIST Framework is a comprehensive framework that provides a set of best practices for managing cybersecurity risks. It consists of five core functions:

* Identify
* Protect
* Detect
* Respond
* Recover

**What is a Maturity Assessment?**

A maturity assessment is a process of evaluating an organization's cybersecurity posture against a set of best practices. The goal of a maturity assessment is to identify areas where the organization can improve its cybersecurity resilience.

**Risk Registers**

I also wrote risk registers for these maturity assessments that the client would use to improve their maturity ratings. (screenshot of risk register)

**Key Considerations for Completing the Risk Register**

* **Identify the risks:** I identified the risks that could affect the organization's cybersecurity posture.
* **Assess the risks:** I assessed the likelihood and impact of each risk.
* **Develop mitigation strategies:** I developed mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood and impact of each risk.

**Adherence to Company Guidelines**

I adhered to the company guidelines when filling out the risk registers. The guidelines included specific requirements for the format and content of the risk registers.

**Result**

I was able to deliver the deliverables to be used in BAU for the client so that the client could conduct future maturity assessments.

**Benefits of the Risk Registers**

* **Improved risk management:** The risk registers helped the client to identify and manage cybersecurity risks.
* **Enhanced cybersecurity resilience:** The risk registers helped the client to improve its cybersecurity resilience by reducing the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents.
* **Compliance with regulations:** The risk registers helped the client to comply with cybersecurity regulations.
